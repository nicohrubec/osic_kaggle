# osic_kaggle
Very simple top 10 % solution for the OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression Kaggle Compeition.

# Task
The task in this competition was to predict lung function decline for a given patient based on some basic demographics and a CT scan of his lung.

# Solution
In this repo you can find a small adaptation of my very simple final solution which is just a simple Ridge predicting the lung function delta to first visit instead of the absolute fvc values. I did not use the images at all.
